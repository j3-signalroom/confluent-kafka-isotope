# Flink SQL reports

Seven reports that read two streams of isotope metadata — the
**produce side** (the `x-isotope-*` headers stamped on every event
topic record by `IsotopeProducerInterceptor`) and the **consume
side** (the value-less marker records on `platform.observability.consume_events`
emitted by `IsotopeContext.recordConsume`) — and surface what's
flowing where, how fast, and how reliably. Each report runs as a
long-lived `INSERT INTO <report>_1m SELECT …` streaming job. The
aggregation logic is identical across runtimes; only the
source/sink DDL and function-registration glue differ.

The headline addition is the `bipartite_topology` report: it unions
the produce and consume views to render the pipeline as a literal
[**bipartite graph**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph)
from graph theory — services in one vertex set, topics in the other,
edges crossing between them in both directions. See [root README §1.0
"Background — why 'bipartite'?"](../../README.md#10-how-the-isotope-is-carried)
for the full motivation.

| Runtime | Reports | Sink format | Where the SQL lives |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Confluent Platform Flink** (cp-flink 2.1.2 session cluster on Minikube) | 7 (latency, topology, bipartite-topology, hop-distribution, coverage, stuck-trace, latency-percentiles) | `avro-confluent` (SR-framed Avro) | [scripts/flink/sql/cp/](sql/cp/) — applied by [scripts/deploy-cp-flink-reports.sh](../deploy-cp-flink-reports.sh) |
| **Confluent Cloud for Apache Flink (CCAF)** | 7 (same set as CP) | `proto-registry` (SR-framed Protobuf) | Inlined as `confluent_flink_statement` resources in [terraform/setup-confluent-flink.tf](../../terraform/setup-confluent-flink.tf) — applied by [scripts/deploy-cc-flink-reports.sh](../deploy-cc-flink-reports.sh) |

Control Center deserializes both sink formats natively.

## What each report computes

Every report aggregates over a `TUMBLE(event_time, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE)`
window. The "Source view" column names the typed view (or views) the
report reads from; the views in turn filter the single `isotope_raw`
source table by the presence/absence of the
`x-isotope-consumer-service` header.

Every report also carries a **`pipeline`** column (decoded from the
`x-isotope-pipeline` header) as a leading grouping dimension, so rows
for an `orders` pipeline and a `location` pipeline never aggregate
together. The "What it computes" column below lists the *additional*
keys each report groups by, on top of `pipeline`.

| Report | Source view | What it computes | Runtimes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `latency`            | `isotope`                 | avg / min / max end-to-end latency by `origin_service × current_topic` | CP, CCAF |
| `topology`           | `isotope`                 | produce-edge counts per `(producer_service, topic)` per minute | CP, CCAF |
| `bipartite_topology` | `isotope` ∪ `consume_events` | full bipartite graph: produce edges + consume edges per minute | CP, CCAF |
| `hop_distribution`   | `isotope`                 | record counts bucketed by `hop_count` per topic per minute | CP, CCAF |
| `coverage`           | `isotope`                 | distinct traces per topic per minute | CP, CCAF |
| `stuck_trace`        | `isotope`                 | alerts (via `STUCK_TRACE_PTF`) for traces idle ≥60s of event time | CP, CCAF |
| `latency_percentiles`| `isotope`                 | p50 / p95 / p99 (via `LATENCY_PERCENTILES` PTF, T-Digest) | CP, CCAF |

## Format-by-runtime, not by domain

The sink **format** differs by runtime for one platform-level reason:

- **cp-flink ships SR-Avro but not SR-Protobuf.** Apache Flink
  open-source publishes
  [`flink-sql-avro-confluent-registry`](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/docs/connectors/table/formats/avro-confluent/);
  there is no SR-integrated Protobuf equivalent. We could hand-write
  one (~150 lines wrapping `flink-protobuf` with magic-byte framing
  + SR client) but Avro already gives us Control Center decoding with
  zero custom code. CCAF has SR-Protobuf, so its sinks use it.

The report **set** is identical on both runtimes — but that took a
deliberate choice for percentiles: **CCAF rejects all user-defined
aggregate functions** with `aggregate functions are not supported`,
regardless of accumulator shape. So `LATENCY_PERCENTILES` is
implemented as a `ProcessTableFunction` (T-Digest sketch + per-window
state and timers), not an aggregate function — a PTF registers and
runs on both runtimes, same as `STUCK_TRACE_PTF`.

The demo *event* topics (`orders.placed`, `orders.enriched`, `orders.fulfilled`)
ride Protobuf+SR via the Java app's `DemoEvent` schema on both runtimes —
those are written by the Kafka producer client, not by Flink, so the
SR-Protobuf gap doesn't apply.

## Layout

```
scripts/flink/sql/cp/                   CP Flink — session-cluster SQL
  00_source_table.fql                   CREATE TABLE per topic ('connector' = 'kafka') + isotope_raw UNION view
  01_register_functions.fql             CREATE FUNCTION … USING JAR 'file:///opt/flink/lib/isotope-flink-udf.jar'
  05_isotope_view.fql                   Typed view; decodes x-isotope-* header scalars (produces only)
  06_consume_events_view.fql            Typed view of platform.observability.consume_events markers (consume edges)
  05_report_sinks.fql                   CREATE TABLE for each isotope_report_*_1m Kafka sink (avro-confluent)
  10_latency_report.fql                 INSERT INTO: avg/min/max latency by origin × topic
  20_topology_report.fql                INSERT INTO: produce-edge counts per minute
  25_bipartite_topology_report.fql      INSERT INTO: produce ∪ consume edges (bipartite graph) per minute
  30_hop_distribution.fql               INSERT INTO: hop-count buckets per topic per minute
  40_coverage_report.fql                INSERT INTO: distinct traces per topic per minute
  60_stuck_trace_report.fql             INSERT INTO: stuck-trace alerts via STUCK_TRACE_PTF
  70_latency_percentiles_report.fql     INSERT INTO: p50/p95/p99 via LATENCY_PERCENTILES PTF (T-Digest)
  99_teardown.fql                       DROP TABLE/VIEW/FUNCTION (companion to flink-reports-down)
```

CCAF runs the same seven reports, but the SQL lives inline as
`confluent_flink_statement` resources in
[terraform/setup-confluent-flink.tf](../../terraform/setup-confluent-flink.tf)
— 23 statements: ALTER (×4) + raw view + typed produce view + typed
consume view + 7 sinks + `STUCK_TRACE_PTF` and `LATENCY_PERCENTILES`
registrations (×2) + 7 INSERTs. The JAR is uploaded as a
`confluent_flink_artifact` and referenced via
`USING JAR 'confluent-artifact://<id>'`.

## Wire-format detail (CP only)

Window columns ride as `BIGINT` epoch millis on the wire, not
`TIMESTAMP_LTZ`. Flink 2.1.2's `avro-confluent` schema-derivation
path raises `UnsupportedOperationException: Unsupported to derive
Schema for type: TIMESTAMP_LTZ(3)` for that type. We cast in the
INSERT (`UNIX_TIMESTAMP(CAST(window_start AS STRING)) * 1000`) so the
on-wire schema is plain Avro `long`. Consumers rehydrate via
`TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(window_start, 3)`. The CCAF Protobuf sinks don't
hit this — `proto-registry` handles `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` directly.

## PTF JAR

The single shadow JAR `ptf/build/libs/isotope-flink-udf.jar`
(produced by `./gradlew :ptf:shadowJar`) carries both JAR-backed
functions — both `ProcessTableFunction`s — under the
`ai.signalroom.kafka.isotope.flink` package:

- `LatencyPercentilesPTF` (registered as `LATENCY_PERCENTILES`) —
  T-Digest p50/p95/p99 via per-window state + event-time timers.
- `StuckTracePTF` — per-trace state + event-time timer that emits
  alerts for traces idle ≥60s.

Both register on both runtimes; only the `CREATE FUNCTION … USING JAR …`
clause differs (`file://` path on CP, `confluent-artifact://` reference
on CCAF).

## Operations

**CP Flink (Minikube):**

```bash
make flink-up           # cert-manager → CFK Flink Operator → CMF → session cluster
make flink-reports-up   # build PTF JAR, copy to JM, create sink topics, submit 7 INSERT INTO jobs
make flink-sql          # interactive SQL Client (auto-loads sink DDL so SELECT * works)
make flink-reports-down # cancel jobs, drop tables, delete sink topics + SR subjects
make flink-down         # tear down cluster + operator + cert-manager
```

**CCAF (Confluent Cloud, Terraform-driven):**

```bash
make cc-flink-reports-up   CONFLUENT_API_KEY=... CONFLUENT_API_SECRET=...
                           # terraform apply: env + cluster + topics + compute pool + artifact + 23 statements
                           # also regenerates terraform/terraform.png via `terraform graph | dot`
source scripts/cc-cli-env.sh          # exports BOOTSTRAP / SR_URL / KAFKA_KEY / KAFKA_SECRET / SR_KEY / SR_SECRET / JAAS
scripts/cc-app-run.sh send orders.placed order-intake-service 'hello'   # drives traffic with the SASL config
make cc-flink-reports-down CONFLUENT_API_KEY=... CONFLUENT_API_SECRET=...
                           # terraform destroy: deletes the environment and everything in it
```
