# Runbook — Confluent Platform + Flink on Minikube

End-to-end operational guide for running `confluent-kafka-isotope` locally on
**Minikube**: cluster → Kafka/Confluent Platform → Flink → SQL reports → traffic
→ observe → teardown. Every step maps to a target in the [Makefile](../Makefile),
which is the source of truth.

> This is the **Confluent Platform (self-managed) on Minikube** path. The
> Confluent Cloud for Apache Flink (CCAF) path is entirely different —
> Terraform-driven via `make cc-flink-reports-up`, no Minikube — see
> [README §4.5](../README.md#45-flink-sql-reports-on-confluent-cloud-for-apache-flink-ccaf).

## 0. Prerequisites (once per machine)

```bash
make install-prereqs     # docker, kubectl, minikube, helm, gettext, gradle, openjdk17
make check-prereqs       # verify they're on PATH
```

Default Minikube sizing (override via env): `MINIKUBE_CPUS=6`, `MINIKUBE_MEM=20480`,
`MINIKUBE_DISK=50g`. The node architecture is auto-detected so the right
`cp-flink` image (amd64/arm64) is selected.

## 1. Cluster + Confluent Platform

```bash
make cp-up               # = check-prereqs → minikube-start → operator-install → cp-deploy
make cp-watch            # watch pods come up (Ctrl+C to exit); or: make cp-status
```

`cp-up` boots Minikube, installs the CFK (Confluent for Kubernetes) operator, and
deploys Kafka (KRaft) + Schema Registry + Connect + ksqlDB + REST Proxy + Control
Center into the `confluent` namespace.

> `cp-up` deliberately does **not** bring up Flink — run [step 2](#2-flink)
> separately.

## 2. Flink

```bash
make flink-up            # cert-manager → Flink operator → CMF → CMF env → session cluster
make flink-status        # (~5 min the first time)
```

This installs cert-manager, the Confluent Flink Kubernetes Operator, CMF
(Confluent Manager for Apache Flink), creates the `dev-local` Flink environment,
and deploys a `cp-flink` **session cluster** (Flink 2.1.2) with 8 task slots.

## 3. Port-forward Kafka

```bash
make kafka-pf-up         # localhost:30092 → Kafka, localhost:8081 → SR
```

Prereq for everything the host-run gradle app does — `App.java`'s defaults
already point at `localhost:30092` / `localhost:8081`. Stop with
`make kafka-pf-down`.

## 4. Deploy the 7 Flink SQL reports

```bash
make flink-reports-up    # builds PTF shadow JAR → uploads to JobManager → pre-creates
                         # 7 sink topics → applies source/view/sink DDL → submits
                         # 7 INSERT INTO streaming jobs (one per report)
```

Five reports are pure Flink SQL; two are JAR-backed `ProcessTableFunction`s
(`LatencyPercentilesPTF`, `StuckTracePTF`). Sink topics use Apache Flink's
`avro-confluent` format — SR-framed Avro, auto-registered on first write — so
Control Center renders the rows natively. Drop everything with
`make flink-reports-down`.

## 5. Drive traffic (required to see report rows)

All report jobs aggregate over `TUMBLE(event_time, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE)` windows,
which only emit when the watermark advances past `window_end`. Spread records
across **multiple** windows:

```bash
# 30 records, 5s apart ≈ 2.5 min of event-time → spans 3+ windows
for i in {1..30}; do ./gradlew :app:run --args="place burst-$i" -q; sleep 5; done
```

Or run the pipeline-position stages, each in its own terminal:

```bash
./gradlew :app:run --args="place hello"   # origin → orders.placed
./gradlew :app:run --args="enrich"        # orders.placed   → orders.enriched
./gradlew :app:run --args="fulfill"       # orders.enriched → orders.fulfilled
./gradlew :app:run --args="ship"          # terminal consume orders.fulfilled
```

Wait ~90s after the **last** record before checking results — that's the
watermark catching up. `stuck_trace_alerts_1m` only fires for a trace that goes
≥60s of event time without a fresh hop; to exercise it, send one record to
`orders.placed`, skip the `enrich`/`fulfill` hops, and keep sending unrelated
records so the watermark crosses `event_time + 60s`.

## 6. Observe

```bash
make c3-open             # Control Center — report topics render natively (Avro+SR)
make flink-sql           # interactive Flink SQL client inside the JobManager pod
make flink-ui            # Flink job graph / watermarks
make metrics-up          # optional: Prometheus + Grafana for the stateless meters
```

The metrics showcase has its own runbook —
[k8s/monitoring/README.md](../k8s/monitoring/README.md) (and the meter/PromQL
reference in [docs/metrics.md](metrics.md)).
Stop the background port-forwards with `make c3-stop` / `make flink-ui-stop` /
`make metrics-down`.

## 7. Teardown

Pick the depth:

```bash
make flink-reports-down  # drop reports / views / functions only
make metrics-delete      # remove the Prometheus/Grafana showcase (pods + namespace)
make flink-down          # Flink cluster + CMF + operator + cert-manager
make cp-down             # CP + operator (keeps Minikube running)
make confluent-teardown  # everything + stop Minikube
make nuke                # confluent-teardown + minikube-delete + uninstall-prereqs (factory reset)
```

## Minimal path (no Flink)

To just watch a trace propagate without the Flink SQL reports:

```bash
make cp-up
make kafka-pf-up
./gradlew :app:run --args="place hello"   # then enrich / fulfill / ship
```

Flink ([step 2](#2-flink)) and the reports ([step 4](#4-deploy-the-7-flink-sql-reports))
are only needed for the SQL report topics.

## Troubleshooting

- **Pods stuck `Pending`.** Minikube is under-resourced — raise `MINIKUBE_CPUS` /
  `MINIKUBE_MEM` and `make minikube-delete && make cp-up`.
- **Flink job submission fails (`services` forbidden).** The supplemental RBAC
  didn't apply — `make flink-rbac`.
- **No report rows.** Almost always the watermark — see
  [step 5](#5-drive-traffic-required-to-see-report-rows); traffic must span
  multiple 1-minute windows and you must wait ~90s after the last record.
- **App can't reach Kafka.** `make kafka-pf-up` isn't running, or the forward
  died — re-run it and confirm `localhost:30092` / `localhost:8081` are live.
- **Control Center's Flink tab is blank.** CMF proxy connectivity —
  `make cmf-proxy-inject` (and `make cmf-proxy-logs` to debug).
